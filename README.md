### üîç Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive approach to a machine learning classification task, including data preprocessing, model development, and deployment. The project is structured to facilitate reproducibility and scalability, making it suitable for various classification problems.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components

* **Data Handling**: Organizes and processes datasets to prepare them for model training.
* **Model Development**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to build classification models.
* **Deployment**: Includes scripts and configurations for deploying the model as a web application.
* **Version Control**: Employs GitHub workflows for continuous integration and delivery.

### üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files:

* `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
* `notebooks/`: Houses Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
* `src/`: Holds source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
* `templates/`: Includes HTML templates for the web application interface.
* `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for automation.
* `app.py`: The main application file for the deployed model.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
* `setup.py`: Script for setting up the project environment.
* `Dockerfile`: Configuration file for containerizing the application.
* `template.py`: A template script for model training and evaluation.([GitHub][1])

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manikrishna-m/Classification-Project.git
   cd Classification-Project
   ```



2. **Set Up the Environment**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```



This will start the web application, allowing you to interact with the classification model.([GitHub][2])
